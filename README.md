## üìÅ Structure

- `data/` ‚Äì Sample data (or download scripts)
- `plots/` ‚Äì Directory where plots will be saved
- `scripts/` ‚Äì Python scripts for demonstrations or assignments
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì List of required Python packages

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

You can set up your environment using either `venv` (standard Python virtual environments) or `conda/miniconda`. Choose one of the following:

---

### üêç Option 1: Using `venv` (Python 3.10 recommended)

1. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ml-env
   ```

2. **Activate the environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source ml-env/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\ml-env\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install --upgrade pip
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
---

### üß™ Option 2: Using `conda` / `miniconda`

1. **Create a new conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n ml-env python=3.10
   ```

2. **Activate the environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate ml-env
   ```

3. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Data Initialization

To download all necessary data,
run the following scripts inside the data folder:

```bash
   cd  data
   bash download_alexnet.sh
   bash download_ecg_models.sh
   bash download_ecgs.sh
   bash download_images.sh
   ```

## üìù Notes

- This repository assumes basic familiarity with Python and Shell comands.
- GPU acceleration is not required but may speed up certain examples if available (you can use https://colab.google/ for that purpose).
